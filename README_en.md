## Introduction

> duetector is one of the components in the DataUCON project, which is designed to provide support for data usage control. [Intro DataUCON](https://dataucon.idslab.io/).

duetectorüîç is an eBPF-based data usage control probe that provides support for data usage control by probing for data usage behavior in the Linux kernel.

**üêõüêûüß™ The project is under heavy development, looking forward to any bug reports, feature requests, pull requests!**

In the [ABAUC control model](https://github.com/hitsz-ids/dataucon), duetector can be used as a PIP (Policy Information Point) to obtain data usage behavior, so as to provide information about data usage behavior for PDP (Policy Decision Point). Provide information on data usage behavior to PDP (Policy Decision Point).

## Installation

The code is distributed via Pypi, and you can install it with the following command

```bash
pip install duetector
```

Currently, the code relies on [BCC](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc) for on-the-fly compilation of eBPF code, we recommend [installing the latest BCC compiler](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/INSTALL.md)

Or use the Docker image that we provide, which uses [JupyterLab](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab) as the **example** user application, or you can modify the [Dockerfile](./docker/Dockerfile) and [startup script](./docker/start.sh) to customize the user application.

```bash
docker pull dataucon/duetector:latest
```

Pre-releases will not be updated to `latest`, you can specify the tag to pull, e.g. `v0.0.1a`

```bash
docker pull dataucon/duetector:v0.0.1a
```

For more details on running with docker images see [here](./docs/how-to/run-with-docker.md)

## Quick start

Start monitor using the command line, since bcc requires root privileges, we use the `sudo` command, which will start all probes and collect the probes into the `duetector-dbcollector.sqlite3` file in the current directory

```bash
sudo duectl start
```

Press `CRTL+C` to exit monitoring and you will see a summary output on the screen

```
{'DBCollector': {'OpenTracer': {'count': 31, 'first at': 249920233249912, 'last': Tracking(tracer='OpenTracer', pid=641616, uid=1000, gid= 1000, comm='node', cwd=None, fname='SOME-FILE', timestamp=249923762308577, extended={})}}}
```

Enable `DEBUG` log

```bash
sudo DUETECTOR_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG duectl start
```

At startup, the configuration file will be automatically generated at `~/.config/duetector`, and you can specify the configuration file to use with `--config`.

```bash
sudo duectl start --config <config-file-path>
```

When using a plugin, the default configuration file will not contain the plugin's configuration, use the dynamically-generated configuration directive to generate a configuration file with the plugin's configuration, this directive also supports merging existing configuration files and environment variables.

```bash
duectl generate-dynamic-config --help
```

Use `generate-config` to restore the default state in case of configuration file errors.

```bash
duectl generate-config
```

Going a step further, running in the background you can use the `duectl-daemon start` command, which will run a daemon in the background, which you can stop using `duectl-daemon stop`

```bash
$ duectl-daemon --help

Usage: duectl-daemon [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  start   Start a daemon of command `duectl start`, All arguments after...
  status  Status of daemon Determined by the existence of pid file in...
  stop    Stop daemon Determined by the existence of pid file in `workdir`
```
