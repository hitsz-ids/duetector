## Introduction

> duetector is one of the components in the DataUCON project, which is designed to provide support for data usage control. [Intro DataUCON](https://dataucon.idslab.io/).

duetectorüîç is an eBPF-based data usage control probe that provides support for data usage control by probing for data usage behavior in the Linux kernel.

In the [ABAUC control model](https://github.com/hitsz-ids/dataucon), duetector can be used as a PIP (Policy Information Point) to obtain data usage behavior, so as to provide information about data usage behavior for PDP (Policy Decision Point). Provide information on data usage behavior to PDP (Policy Decision Point).

## Feature

TBD

TODO: Features and corresponding [kernel config](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/docs/kernel_config.md)

## Installation

The code is distributed via Pypi, and you can install it with the following command

```bash
pip install duetector
```

Currently, the code relies on [BCC](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc) for on-the-fly compilation of eBPF code, we recommend [installing the latest BCC compiler](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/INSTALL.md)

Or use the Docker image that we provide

```bash
docker pull dataucon/duetector:latest
```

Pre-releases will not be updated on `latest`, you can specify the tag to pull, e.g. `v0.1.0`

```bash
docker pull dataucon/duetector:v0.1.0
```
